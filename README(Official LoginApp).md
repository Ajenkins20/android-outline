Project Description: For my project, I created an app where you can create your account on my Login App using your email address and password.

Problem Addressing: When I was putting in the code and programming my Login App, there might be problems that you may encounter while using my Login App. Such as, you may have trouble logging in due to incorrect credentials or any authentication errors.

Platform: My Login App can be accessed through any smartphone device whether it is an iPhone or Android.

Front/Back end support: The front end of my Login App has a user interface where users can enter their login credentials and interact with the app. This can be implemented using HTML and JavaScript. For the back-end support, it will have authentication which will verify users' credentials and protect against unauthorized access.

Functionality: The main reason for the functionality of my Login App will involve the purpose of allowing users to securely authenticate and access their accounts. For instance, my app enables users to log into their accounts using their username/email and password.

Design(wireframes): The design wireframe from my login app is that users would need to create an account using their username/email and password and then click on create an account/sign in.
