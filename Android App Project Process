I want to develop and create a app where it allows users to customize their mobile phone keypad. The purpose of my app is to allow people to customize their keypad based on their choice of interest. 
I want to ensure that creating this app will be located in their phone's setting such as personalization or accessibility purposes.
My target audience could be anyone who uses a smarphone whether it is a Android or iPhone. Plus, it could also be a specific group who have difficulty using a standard keypad or those who want to personalize 
their phone's appearance. The features and functionality of my app will provide users with a range of customization options, such as changing the color/theme, size, and layout of keys. My app will also have multiple keypad
layouts so they can switch between them easily. The platform of my app will be developed for Android. Based on monetization, I will display offering in-app purchases, it will not be expensive but if a user want more features
for their keypad, the price will be afforable.
