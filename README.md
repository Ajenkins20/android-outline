Problem description: The app has many options to customize your phone keypad.

Problem addressing: One problem faced by many people is the difficulty of typing efficiently on the phone keypad. Many individuals find it challenging to use a default phone keypad, which can result in incorrect words and lead to frustration. My goal is to create an app to provide a customizable phone keypad that allows people to personalize the layout, size, and design of the keypad.

Platform: The app that I will create will be developed for mobile devices such as iPhones and Androids. 

Front/Back End Support: To develop the front end of the app, I will use JavaScript for building a mobile app. For the back end, I will use Android Studio to create the web application.

Functionality: The functionality of the app has benefits that can allow users to rearrange the position of keys on the keypad according to their preferences. The app will allow users to pinch and expand gestures to adjust the size of the keys of their choice. Also, the app will provide a library of themes with different color schemes, patterns, and fonts.

Design (Wireframes): Based on the app that I will be creating, the wireframe will show a standard phone keypad layout with alphanumeric keys, a space key, and a backspace key. Users can tap and hold on a key to enter the customization mode. In the mode, they can drag or drop keys to reposition their positions on the keypad.
